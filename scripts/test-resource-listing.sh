# Instructions for running
cat << 'EOF'

## How to run this test:

1. Start OpenFGA server:
   ./scripts/start-openfga.sh

2. Load the authorization model and tuples:
   ./scripts/demo.sh

3. Start the API server:
   cargo run

4. Set environment variables:
   export OPENFGA_STORE_ID="your_store_id"

5. Run this test script:
   chmod +x ./scripts/test-resource-listing.sh
   ./scripts/test-resource-listing.sh

## Expected Results:

- Carl: Should see all connector resources (service sharing)
- Emily: Should see only s3 resources (service-type sharing)  
- Diana: Should see shared resources + direct gcs access
- Alice: Should see owned system resources
